# Git LineCount

Simple cumulative line count per author tool for git in Python 2.

This program sums the output from `git show --numstat` to actual number of
inserted/removed lines, unlike other line counting tools which use `--stat` to
estimate line counts (good luck with that, lol).

The source is currently the only documentation.
